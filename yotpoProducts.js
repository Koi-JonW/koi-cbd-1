We believe this process provides a higher quality more consistent product.\n\nSuggested use:\n\n Adults take 1 Gummy, 1-3 times per day, or as needed\n Wait 3 hours after initial (first time) use to see how the level of CBD may affect you\n Serving Size: 1 Gummy\n Servings Per Container: 6 or 20\n\nIngredients: Organic Naturally Occurring CBD in Hemp Oil Proprietary Blend Infusion, Water, Gelatin, Sugar, Corn Syrup, Adipic (for tartness), Citric Acid (for tartness), Natural and Artificial Flavoring, Yellow 5, Yellow 6, Red 40\n\nSTORAGE: Store in a cool, dry place away from excessive heat, light, and humidity in order to preserve quality.\n\nWARNING: Not to be used during pregnancy or lactation.
